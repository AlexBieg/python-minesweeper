## A console minesweeper game

### About
I saw a post on reddit a while back that showed a minesweeper AI. I thought
it sounded like a fun project to do myself. I looked into the built in minesweeper and discovered that there was no great way to hook into the game. So I decided to make my own in python that I can then hook an AI up to. Currently the game is totally playable through the console.

### How to play
Just run the python script titled 'minesweeper.py' and it will start the game. Choose the board size and number of mines and you are playing.
